# nano-tweezers-modeling-with-comsol
We report the new system for manipulation of nanoobjects based on composite Ti2NiCu/Pt nanotweezers with shape memory effect. The design consists of the bimetallic Ti2NiCu/Pt shape memory nanotweezers placed on a tip of electrochemically etched tungsten needle. The semiconductor diode placed on the tip of the needle plays both role of resistive element of the heater and temperature sensor for feedback control loop closing. The device is compatible with existing positioning systems like OmniProbe®, Kleindiek®, etc. and may find numerous practical applications in various tasks of nanotechnology connected with 3D manipulation.
